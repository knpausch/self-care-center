# Self-Care Center

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I created a meditative website that allows the user to chose between affirmation or mantra quotes. These quotes will randomly generate and not repeat themselves until the user has seen them all. When people are going through a stressful moment, they can relax and interact with this website to meditate.
